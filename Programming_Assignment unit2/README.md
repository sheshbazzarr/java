# Assignment Title: Creating a Simple E-commerce System
Through this assignment, students will gain knowledge and skills in several important areas of Java programming, software design, and best practices like organization of code.   

## Assignment Instructions:  
In this assignment, you will create a simple e-commerce system for an online store using Java. The system allows customers to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and place orders. The focus is on organizing the code using Java packages and the import statement for better encapsulation. 


`Scenario: You are tasked with building a simple e-commerce system for an online store. This system should allow customers to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and place orders. To ensure proper organization and encapsulation, you will be using Java packages and the import  statement.  `

## Requirements: 

Create a Java package named com.ecommerce  to encapsulate all classes related to the e-commerce system.  

Inside the com.ecommerce package, create the following classes:  
* a. Product class: This class should represent a product available for purchase. Include attributes like productID, name, price, and any other relevant fields. Implement the necessary constructors, getters, setters, and any other methods for product-related operations. 


* b. Customer class: This class should represent a customer with attributes like customerID, name, and a shopping cart. Implement methods to add and remove products from the shopping cart, calculate the total cost, and place orders.  

Create a package named  com.ecommerce.orders  for managing orders. 

Inside the com.ecommerce.orders  package, create the following classes:

- a. Order class: This class should represent an order placed by a customer. Include attributes like orderID, customer, products, and the order total. Implement methods to generate order summaries, update order status, and manage order information.  

In the main program (outside of packages), demonstrate the use of packages and the import statement by:  
- a. Creating instances of products, customers, and orders.  

- b. Allowing customers to browse products, add them to their shopping cart, and place orders.  

- c. Displaying information about products, customers, and orders.  

Make sure to import the necessary classes from the com.ecommerce and com.ecommerce.orders  packages into the main program.  

Use appropriate access modifiers to ensure proper encapsulation and data hiding.  




## Guidelines
Use meaningful variables and method names to make your code more readable.  
Implement proper error handling to deal with exceptions, especially for order placement and management.  
Ensure that your code is well-structured and organized within packages.
