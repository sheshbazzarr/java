# Online Chat Application 

## Instruction:

developing a simple online chat application using Java. The application should allow multiple users to connect to a `central server`, `send messages`, and `receive messages` from other users.


## Requirements: 

### Server Implementation
*a.Server Setup*
- Create a server class, `ChatServer`, 
- Use ServerSocket to listen for incoming client connections.
- using socket programming to manage connections from multiple clients
*b.Handle Client Connections*
- Assign a unique user ID to each client upon connection.
- Maintain a list of connected clients in a data structure (like a `HashMap` or `List`)
*c.Broadcast Messages*
- When a message is received from a client, broadcast it to all connected clients
- Ensure that the server is capable of handling messages concurrently from multiple clients.
### Client Implementation(ChatClient)
*a.Client Setup*
- Create a `ChatClient` class
- Connect to the server using `Socket`
- Create a separate thread to handle incoming messages from the server so that the user can continue typing while messages are received.
*b.sending Messages*
- Implement a method for the client to send messages to the server.
- 
- 
    - Implement a client class, ChatClient, that connects to the server using sockets.  
    -  Each client should be able to send messages to the server, which will broadcast the messages to all connected clients. 
    - Clients should also be able to receive messages from other users
### User Interface: 
    - Include a simple text-based for the client to facilitate message input and display.
