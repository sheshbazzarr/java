# Online Chat Application 

## Instruction:

developing a simple online chat application using Java. The application should allow multiple users to connect to a `central server`, `send messages`, and `receive messages` from other users.


## Requirements: 

### Server Implementation
 -
    - Create a server class, ChatServer, using socket programming to manage connections from multiple clients
    - The server should be able to handle incoming connections, assign a unique user ID to each connected client, and maintain a list of connected users.
### Client Implementation
    - Implement a client class, ChatClient, that connects to the server using sockets.  
    -  Each client should be able to send messages to the server, which will broadcast the messages to all connected clients. 
    - Clients should also be able to receive messages from other users
### User Interface: 
    - Include a simple text-based for the client to facilitate message input and display.
